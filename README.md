Improving grammar and spell check features in Microsoft Word involves utilizing external libraries or APIs that offer advanced language processing capabilities.

The library returns a list of matches representing potential errors. We then iterate over the matches and highlight the errors by applying bold formatting to the corresponding text in the Word document.
